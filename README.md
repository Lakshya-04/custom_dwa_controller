# Custom DWA Local Planner for TurtleBot3 in ROS 2 Humble

This project is a complete implementation of a custom **Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)** local planner, built from scratch as a `nav2_core::Controller` plugin for the ROS 2 Humble Navigation Stack. The planner is designed to navigate a TurtleBot3 in an Ignition Fortress simulation, demonstrating robust path following and dynamic obstacle avoidance.

The entire decision-making logic, from trajectory generation to the multi-objective cost function, is contained within this package, offering a transparent and deeply customizable alternative to the standard Nav2 controllers.

## Key Features & Concepts

- **Custom DWA Algorithm:** A from-scratch implementation that generates velocity commands (`cmd_vel`) based on dynamic window sampling.
- **Multi-Objective Cost Function:** The robot's behavior is driven by a sophisticated and tunable cost function that balances multiple objectives:
  - **Progress:** A reward function that incentivizes forward motion towards the goal, preventing the robot from getting "stuck".
  - **Path Adherence:** A penalty for straying from the global path, ensuring the robot follows the desired route.
  - **Heading:** A penalty for incorrect orientation, which ensures smooth turns and alignment with the path.
  - **Obstacle Avoidance:** A high-priority penalty that uses the Nav2 costmap to guarantee collision-free trajectories.
- **Dynamic Lookahead Point:** Instead of aiming for the final distant goal, the planner intelligently aims for a moving target just ahead on the global path, resulting in much smoother and more stable navigation.
- **RViz Visualization:** The planner publishes all simulated trajectories to a `/local_trajectories` topic as `MarkerArray` messages, providing invaluable insight into the robot's decision-making process.

## How It Works:

At its core, the planner makes decisions by constantly evaluating a simple question: _"Of all the moves I can possibly make in the next second, which one is the best?"_

1. **Dynamic Window:** First, it determines the "dynamic window"â€”the set of all linear and angular velocities that are physically achievable given the robot's current speed and acceleration limits.
2. **Trajectory Simulation:** It then simulates hundreds of short trajectories, one for each velocity pair in the window.
3. **Cost Function Scoring:** Every single trajectory is scored by the cost function. This scoring is a weighted sum of the different behavioral goals. The final cost is calculated as:  
   `TotalCost = (w1 * ProgressReward) + (w2 * PathPenalty) + (w3 * HeadingPenalty) + (w4 * ObstaclePenalty)`
4. **Best Command Selection:** The trajectory with the lowest total cost is chosen, and its corresponding velocity command is sent to the robot.

This entire process repeats at 10-20 Hz, allowing the robot to react dynamically to its environment.

## Setup and Launch Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS 2 Humble and Ignition Fortress installed.
- TurtleBot3 simulation packages.
- Nav2 (`ros-humble-navigation2`) and its dependencies.

### 2. Build the Package

Navigate to your ROS 2 workspace, clone this repository into the `src` folder, and build the package.

```bash
# In your workspace root (e.g., ~/ros2_ws)
colcon build --packages-select custom_dwa_local_planner
```

### 3. Launch the Simulation

In every new terminal, source your workspace first.

```bash
# In your workspace root (e.g., ~/ros2_ws)
source install/setup.bash
```

**Terminal 1: Launch Ignition Gazebo and RViz**
```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot4_ignition_bringup turtlebot4_ignition.launch.py use_sim_time:=true rviz:=true
```

**Terminal 2: Launch SLAM**
```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot4_navigation slam.launch.py use_sim_time:=true
```

**Terminal 3: Launch Nav2 with your custom DWA parameters**
```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot4_navigation nav2.launch.py use_sim_time:=true params_file:=$(ros2 pkg prefix custom_dwa_local_planner)/share/custom_dwa_local_planner/config/tb4_custom_nav2_params.yaml
```

> **Note:**  
> Always source your workspace's `setup.bash` in every terminal before running these commands.

### 4. Navigate and Visualize!

In RViz, use the "2D Pose Estimate" button to initialize the robot's position on the map.

Add a MarkerArray display (from the "Add" button) and subscribe to the `/local_trajectories` topic to see the planner's thoughts.

Use the "Nav2 Goal" button to set a destination. Watch as the robot navigates, and see the trajectories it considers in real-time!
